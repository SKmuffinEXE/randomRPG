**Simple RPG**

Simple RPG, originally called random RPG but the name didn't run off the tongue as much.  

This is an app to see how much of a functioning game I could make in the alotted time I had to create this project.  I wanted to make a simple and easy to understand turn based RPG, where the player fights randomly selected monsters, levels up and gets gold to buy stuff from the store.

**Technologies**

React

ruby/ruby on rails - the code that generates the back end information.

postgress - the actual back end 

html/css/JSX -  Front end coding, that's already part of react.

Heroku  - Where the game is hosted.  You can visit the game at: https://fi-p5-random-rpg.herokuapp.com

bcrypt - Handles the user login/signup authentications.



**Features**

-Can create a new character.
